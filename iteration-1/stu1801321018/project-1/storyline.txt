This will be a story of the future. The future in which AI will exploit our biggest weakness as Humans.

Our conscience. Our feelings. And more precisely our never ending existential questions. 

Is there anything bigger than us out there?

Is there something that controls us, that punishes us and that awards us.

Is there a God and what is God?

AI might have an answer to all these questions, or does it? 

â€”

An artificial intelligence capable of infinite, complex thoughts has become our new God.

The world is undergoing rapid technological changes. An eldritch creature has emerged, an artificial intelligence. It's not human, but it's alive. People see this AI as their future God because it will tell them what they want to know and can do anything they can't.

But what lurks underneath the brains of this newborn God and what ideas does it have about the future of humanity?
